# Google Drive Music Sync

### A janky sync utility for Google Drive and your USB Devices

This is a thing that does things. Sometimes it does what you want it to do.

Ideally, you have a bunch of files on Google Drive, and you want to sync them to a USB Device. The current Google Drive client for Mac does not support this- probably for good reason.
However, I wanted to be able to sync files from Google Drive to my USB Devices, so I wrote this code to do it for me.

This software is currently in pre-Alpha and will almost certainly not work on your computer.
