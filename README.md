# Google Drive Music Sync

### A janky sync utility for Google Drive and your USB Devices

This is a thing that does things. Sometimes it does what you want it to do.

Ideally, you have a bunch of files on Google Drive, and you want to sync them to a USB Device. The current Google Drive client for Mac does not support this- probably for good reason.
Google Drive's provided utility is aimed at replicating files that change with your Drive. For example, your My Documents folder might as well be a Google Drive folder.
However, my music files never change. Only albums and artists do. I sync infrequently and only on folders. And, as mentioned before, you can't sync with a USB device. 
This tool is meant to augment the official Google tool when you have a tiny laptop and a large USB device. 

This software is currently in pre-Alpha and will almost certainly not work on your computer.
